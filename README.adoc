== About
.This is a PowerShell script to check the HWIDs for the following:
* Disk / Drive
* EFI
* Monitor / Display
* Motherboard / SMBIOS
* Network
* Nvidia GPU
* RAM / Memory
* TPM
* USB

It does not check for traces that anti-cheats pick up on.

This script also includes a bare-bones hypervisor detector; https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware[VMAware] and https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser[al-khaser] are much more fleshed out for that use case.
